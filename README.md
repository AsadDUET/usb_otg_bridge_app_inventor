Students, teachers, passionate communication discover the first application to control devices  FTDI UART with  USB connector (Arduino Uno, Mega, Yun, FTDI XBee ...) directly from the development tool APP INVENTOR 2 . (No need for extra Host Shield or Bluetooth. All you need is a Micro USB OTG to USB Adapter.)

USB Bridge for App Inventor 2 allows  through a USB OTG cable to achieve a seamless interface between a USB device and the development tool APP INVENTOR 2.

You'll be able to develop your own new applications using the power of app inventor 2 (graphic, sensors, databases ...) and the powers of your devices available equipped with a USB UART at 115200 bauds

Recycle your old phones and android tablets to achieve beautiful HIM for your microcontroller-based applications.

If your device is not recognized, please send me the references Vendor ID and Product ID as the following example to the arduino uno: Vendor ID: 0x2341, Product ID: 0x0001

USB Host mode support on android device and Android 3.1+ are required


Example:Control an arduino uno card with otg usb and APP INVENTOR  2

Send and receive datas from Arduino with Serial.println(), Serial.print() , Serial.read() in 115200 baud rate.
