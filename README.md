Create in 10 minutes your application on your android tablet that communicates with your Arduino USB board.
Download the following example: https://github.com/S2I71/usb_otg_bridge_app_inventor/

Students, teachers, passionate communication discover the first application to control devices  FTDI UART with  USB connector (Arduino Uno, Mega, Yun, FTDI XBee ...) directly from the development tool APP INVENTOR 2 . (No need for extra Host Shield or Bluetooth. All you need is a Micro USB OTG to USB Adapter.)

USB Bridge for App Inventor 2 allows  through a USB OTG cable to achieve a seamless interface between a USB device and the development tool APP INVENTOR 2.

You'll be able to develop your own new applications using the power of app inventor 2 (graphic, sensors, databases ...) and the powers of your devices available (LED RGB, Servo, AX12A,  DC Motor...) equipped with a USB UART at 115200 bauds

Use and recycle your old phone using its internal functions instead of using multiple Arduino shield: touch screen display, MP3 player, SD card reader, SMS sending, GPD, GSM,QR Codes, NFC, bluetooth, wifi, various sensors .. .. for your microcontroller based applications. (Arduino, Teensy, XBee ...)

If your device is not recognized, please send me the references Vendor ID and Product ID as the following example to the arduino uno: Vendor ID: 0x2341, Product ID: 0x0001

USB Host mode support on android device and Android 3.1+ are required


Example:Control an arduino uno card with otg usb and APP INVENTOR  2

Send and receive datas from Arduino with Serial.println(), Serial.print() , Serial.read() in 115200 baud rate. 

Version  Arduino   program with Ardublock
